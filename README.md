worked with carlton, james, brandon, jagadish 


2.sumshort limited to 255
3.sumlong limited to 65535
4. productfloat limited to 35
5. productdouble limited to 170
6. sumrecip crashes before overflowing
7. Floats store less accurately and were converting from a float to a double. Floats store data in a way that doesn't work well in regards to i in a for loop.

8. Fixed this issue by using a double now.
